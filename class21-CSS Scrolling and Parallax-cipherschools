            <h2>Paragraph</h2>
            <p>Before we dive into paragraph structure, let’s start with paragraph meaning. A paragraph is an individual segment of
                 writing that discusses a central idea, typically with more than one sentence. It even has its own paragraph symbol
                 in copyediting, called the pilcrow (¶), not to be confused with the section symbol called the silcrow (§) that’s 
                 common in legal code.
